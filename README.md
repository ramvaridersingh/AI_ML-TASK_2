# AI_ML-TASK_2
# Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This notebook is part of my AI & ML internship.  
In this task, I explored the Titanic dataset using basic statistics and visualizations to understand the data better.

##Dataset Used
- Titanic Dataset  
- [Download from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly 

## üîç What I Did
- Calculated summary statistics (mean, median, std, etc.)
- Plotted histograms and boxplots for numeric columns
- Created pairplots and a correlation heatmap
- Looked for trends, patterns, and outliers
- Made observations and inferences from visuals

## What I Learned
- How to use EDA to understand data before modeling
- The role of visualizations in spotting patterns and issues
- Basics of correlation and feature relationships

This task helped me build a stronger understanding of real-world data and how to approach it visually.  
Feel free to check out the notebook and suggest improvements!
